## Purpose

MPSH is a simple implementation of a shell in C, 
It demonstrates the basics of how a shell works. 
Many features can exec program, piping, redirection, listing, run backgrounds
Other features I plan to implemnent are Crt-C, Crt-Z, foreground, background, and jobs later

* Only builtins are: `cd`, `exit`.

## Running

Use `make all` to compile in the src folder, and then `./mpsh` to run.
