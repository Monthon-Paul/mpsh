## Purpose

MPSH is a simple implementation of a shell in C, 
It demonstrates the basics of how a shell works. 
Many features can exec program, piping, redirection, listing, run backgrounds, list of jobs, etc.
Other features I plan to implemnent are Ctrl-C, Ctrl-Z, foreground, and background later

* builtins commands: `help`, `quit`, `cd`, `hisotry`, `jobs`.

## Running

Use `make all` to compile in the src folder, and then `./mpsh` to run.
